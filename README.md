Parser for calculating STL volumes
==================================
Refer to Wikipedia for the details of the Stereolithography
file format.

The parser is uses flex and bison as a lexical analyzer generator and
parser generator in order to calculate the volume enclosed by the
triangulated surface. 

The files generated by flex and bison are included in the repository
in case you don't have those tools and want quicker results.

N.B. if you have holes in your volume, namely separate surfaces,
the calculator may give unexpected results.

Peek at the Makefile for more detailed compilation directives.

Compilation
-----------
In the main directory, run:

```
make
```
